# Moms Like Me - Backend

**Moms Like Me** is more than just an app—it's an AI-powered ally designed to help single parents in the Netherlands navigate the complex, often overwhelming world of government benefits.

We combine the empathy of **GreenPT** with the precision of **Neuro-Symbolic AI** (Generative AI + Strict Logic) to turn bureaucratic chaos into clear, verified advice.

## 💔 The Problem
Government websites are built for lawyers, not for tired parents juggling work, kids, and bills. 
- Information is scattered across dozens of pages.
- "Eligibility" is hidden behind complex legal language.
- One small mistake in understanding a rule can cost thousands of euros.

## 🪄 The Magic (How it Works)
We don't just "read" the rules; we understand them. Our backend operates like a digital legal team working 24/7 for you.

### 1. The Analyst (GreenPT)
Our custom **GreenPT** model reads government websites like a human expert would. It doesn't just copy-paste text; it extracts the *logic* behind the benefits. It converts complex sentences like *"You must earn less than €30.000, unless you have 3 children"* into precise, executable code.

### 2. The Auditor (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
We know AI can make mistakes. That's why we have a second layer. **Gemini 2.0 Flash** acts as the auditor, reviewing the logic generated by GreenPT. It runs test cases and "challenges" the system to prove its own accuracy before a user ever sees the data. **Zero hallucinations allowed.**

### 3. The Matchmaker (Neuro-Symbolic Engine)
When you search for help, we don't just keyword match. We run your profile against thousands of verified logic rules instantly. 
- **Strict Logic**: Tells you exactly what you qualify for.
- **Fuzzy Logic**: Tells you when you're *almost* there (e.g., you earn €50 too much for a strict cutoff), so you don't miss out on opportunities because of a technicality.

## � The App (Frontend)
We built a mobile-first experience because we know single parents are often managing their lives on the go.
- **Zero-Friction Interface**: Built with **Vite + React** and **shadcn/ui** for a premium, accessible feel.
- **Visual Clarity**: Complex data is simplified into clear cards and charts (Recharts).
- **Instant Assistance**: Integrated chat interface for real-time guidance.

## �🚀 Key Features

-   **Self-Correcting Knowledge Base**: The system constantly updates and verifies itself. If a rule is ambiguous, it tests it until it's sure.
-   **Context-Aware Search**: Ask " I lost my job, what now?" instead of searching for specific form numbers.
-   **Privacy-First Architecture**: Your data is yours. We use dual authentication to ensure maximum security.
